            <h1 class="margin text-center">CYOA-Project.html</h1>
            <p> Context: The CYOA project was to create a project/game through your IDE and push it too github. For the project, we were assinged to pick a topic to base it on and turn it into a game. For example; "Escaping school". To create the project/game I was given a partner to work with. To start the project, either me or my partner had to create a new repository and invite eachother into it. I created the repository and added my partner to it so that we could code and edit at the same time in our IDES. Furthermore, to create the game/project it had to meet the requirments given. The Requirments: First, my partner and I had to create a plan before we were able to start coding our game/project. The plan had to have boxes with arrows that navigate what comes first then second. The boxes had to be color coded with the color labled next to our name so that it is obvious who was doing which part in the project. Second, the project had to involve at least ten files or more with one sub-directory. Finally, once me and my partner have completed and finished our project, the links of our game, diagram (plan), and github profiles for credits were supposed to be attached to the README of our github.</p>

            ---
            <p>Content: My partner and I created a project/game called "Escape The House". More specifically, It was about a character that we made seem that the person viewing it is the one playing. This character had a mission in which he/she has to play a game in trying to escape the house they are trapped in with only a few hints. Then, at the end when the character comes across a driver, the character is tricked and forced to pick between two choices. No matter what the character ends up choosing, he/she have to face the consquences. To make the project, my partner and I made one folder with fourteen files attached to it. We made each file represnt the character's next step in escaping. Then we based some of those files on the choice the character would pick. </p>

            ---
            <p>Reflection: The project was not only meant to create a game, it was also meant to add to the practice of using our IDES to push and pull with a partner. It was also meant to strengthen our abilties in fixing the conflicts we face while coding such as merging. Including, to learn how to organize and complete a project through our IDES while adding links as well. The project helped me practice all of the listed things. Before it, I still was struggling with using the git codes to push and pull. I was slightly confused on what I had to use first. I also did not know how to add the link to another file through my IDE. However, as I worked with my partner step by step, consistantly looked back at my notes, and got a visual of how I was suppsed to use the git codes to create a project, I gained so much knowledge. Now, if I am given another project like this one, I would confidently complete it while knowing what to exactly do. I would even be able to use the git codes and fix conflicts just as easily. Looking back at my now finished project, I notice that while I was supposed to add two options the viewer can choose from in each file, my partner and I added only one. I also noticed that the text we added was a little rushed which caused some typos. For the future, When given another project like this, I will focus on adding the effect of more than one choice and reading over the text I write so that it comes out organized and smooth. Overall, despite some of the struggle, the project was fun to make. </p>

            ---
            <p>Challenges: The most diffcult part about this project was fixing some of the merge conflicts I came across. During the project, there was some times where a merge conflict would appear because my partner and I would accidentaly make changes to the same file at the same time. This usally happended because my partner and I did not communicate on some parts of the project while coding. To get rid of the merge conflicts, we had to get rid of the random numbers that appaered in the files. Another challenge my partner and I faced was getting rid of broken links when adding them to the files and pushing it to github. We did not know what was causing it. However, after asking a classmate, we learned that the file's link had to be put in brackets and be placed after what the name of the link would appear as on github. At the end, the problems I faced taught me what to do in order to get rid of the conflicts the next time similar situations like this happen.</p>

                <Li>Communication between you and your partner helps create sense of the assignment and helps avoid conflicts</Li>
                <Li>Having your notes out to help you navigate how to use your codes helps make the process of the project easier</Li>
                <Li>Planning out a project before starting it, keeps the project organized and easy while creating it</Li>
