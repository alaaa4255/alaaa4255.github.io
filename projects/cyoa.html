            <h1 class="margin text-center">CYOA-Project.html</h1>
            <p> Context: The CYOA project was to create a project/game through your IDE and push it too github. For the project, we were assinged to pick a topic to base it on and turn it into a game. For example; "Escaping school". To create the project/game I was given a partner to work with. To start the project, either me or my partner had to create a new respitory and invite eachother into it. I created the respitory and added my partner to it so that we could code and edit at the same time in our IDES. Furthermore, to create the game/project it had to meet the requirments given. The Requirments: First, my partner and I had to create a plan before we were able to start coding our game/project. The plan had to have boxes with arrows that navigate what comes first then second. The boxes had to be color coded with the color labled next to our name so that it is obvious who was doing which part in the project. Second, the project had to involve at least ten files or more with one sub-directory. Finally, once me and my partner have completed and finsished our project, The links of our game, diagram (plan), and github profiles for credits were supposed to be attached to the README of our github.</p>

            ---
            <p>Content: My partner and I created a project called "Escape The House". More specifically, It was about a character that we made seem like the person viewing it is the one playing. This character had a mission in which he/she has to play a game in trying to escape the house they are trapped in with only small hints. Then, at the end of the house, the character is tricked by a driver. The driver gives the character two choices in which the character has to choose from. No matter what the character ends up choosing, he/she have to face the consquences. To make the project, my partner and I made one folder with fourteen files attached to it. We made each file represnt the character's next step in escaping.</p>
