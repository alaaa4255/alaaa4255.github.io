            <p> Context: We were supposed to create a website/project that had a thrilling story. Me and my partner's project was based on a fictional superhero who had a head of a soupbowl, he goes on an adventure to stop a war from happeninng. The website is titled "Souperman goes on his first adventure". Prior to everything, we had to first start to plan out the wesbite we would make with our partners. For images, we were supposed to pick two local pictures, however we were also able to use AI for the images. For the CSS part, it was expected to have: element and class, id selectors and
border,padding and margin properties. The website was also expected to have headings, paragraph, divs and spans, as well as different Google fonts, inputs and submit button.
</p>

<p>Challenges: Some challenges We both faced while working on the project was starting it overall. We were confused on how we wanted to start it and what we wanted to add first. I was not expecting it to be that diffcult, I did not want to pick a topic that was too boring or irrelevant. At the end however, me and partner agreed to make it about something fictional as possible with even adding our own twist which involved animals who don't fly, end up flying. We also struggled finding images that matched our plot and had trouble deciding what colors we had wanted to use. So, to solve that, I used DeepAI so that I could have the pictures I wannted customized to perfectly fit the description of the story. However the bigest challenge that I did end up facing was trying to add a sumbit button in the middle and at the end of my project. I was stuck on what element I needed to use. Even when I found out which element I needed for it, I still was stuck on how I was supposed to use it. CSS lesson tutorial and my partner ended up giving me the help I had needed.</p>

 <p>Self-reflection: During the whole process of the project, I tried my best to be involved and tried my best to involve my partner. I contributed in ideas and always asked my partner's opionion before changing something. Next time though, I could work on preparing and organizing my time so that i have time before the deadline to revise all my work. I noticed that I had worked slow, and on the last day of the project me and my partner were a little behind. So, I will practice to aviod situations like that. </p>
