            <p> Context: We were supposed to create a website/project that had a thrilling story. My project was based on a fictional superhero who had a head of a soupbowl, he goes on an adventure to stop a war from happeninng. The website is titled "Souperman goes on his first adventure". Prior to everything, we had to first start to plan out the wesbite we would make with our partners. For images, we were supposed to pick two local pictures,however we were also able to use AI for the images. For the CSS part, it was expected to have: element and class and id selectors and
border and padding and margin properties. The website was also expected to have headings, paragraph, divs and spans. As well as different Google fonts, inputs and submit button.
</p>

<p>Challenges: Some challenges I faced while working on my project was starting it overall. I was confused on how I wanted to start it and what I wanted to add first. I was not expecting it to be that diffcult, I did not want to pick a topic that was too boring or irelevant. At the end however, me and partner agreed to make it about something fictional as possible with even adding our own twist which involved animals who don't fly, end up flying. I also struggled finding images that matched my plot and had trouble deciding what colors I wanted to use. So, to solve that, I used DeepAI so that I could have the pictures i wannted customized to perfectly fit the description of the story. However the bigest challenge that I did face was trying to add a sumbit button in the middle and at the end of my project. I was stuck on what element I needed to use. Even when I found out which element I needed for it, I still was stuck on how I was supposed to use it. CSS lesson tutorial and my partner ended up giving me the help I had needed.</p>
